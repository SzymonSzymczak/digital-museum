Like so many Dynasty 18 monuments, this statue, along with its partner (22.5.1), was usurped a century and a half later by Merneptah, who had it moved from its original location to the eastern portal of the temple. Merneptah's deeply incised titulary contrasts with the restrained carving of the sema tawy (\"Unification of the Two Lands\") motif on both sides of the throne of the other, larger colossus. While the broad, flat planes and bold proportions are typical of Egyptian architectural statuary, these two pieces are distinguished by the quality of their sculptural details, such as the rendering of the faces and the elements of the costumes."

It lies on its side: the forepaws crossed, the farther of the hind paws emerging from under the nearer one, the tail curling forward around the rump and resting on the base. The sculpture combines marvelously the stylized mane and hair with a naturalistic treatment of the body. The muzzle projects realistically, with solid jawbones and raised veins. A stylized circular mane frames the head, and the fur is rendered by a raised surface on the chest, the shoulders, and the back. The eyes are hollowed and were probably inlaid. The whiskers are incised on the muzzle; small, round protuberances in the ear suggest the tufts of hair."
